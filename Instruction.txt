Attached is a base project with side-scrolling player movement controller.

Create some simple behaviour as shown in the video, with this specification:

1. Player can interact with other object with input E.
2. Create 3 interactive object with these behaviours :
	a. object shows bubble text for 1 second
	b. object expand when small, and shrink when big
	c. object goes away from player by 2 unit from its initial position
3. All interactive object have a window time where they cannot receive immediate interaction again in 1 second
4. Player can only interact with 1 object at a time. The first object in contact will have priority

Create these behaviour with clean code in mind. 
The time limit for submission is 24 hours since test files is provided.
Good luck!
